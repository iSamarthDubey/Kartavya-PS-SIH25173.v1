# 1) One-line solution pitch (use this in your proposal)

**“Conversational SIEM Assistant” — a schema-aware NL-to-KQL/DSL middleware that supports multi-turn investigations, context preservation, automated report generation (text + charts), and safe query validation for Elastic/Wazuh via their APIs.**

---

# 2) Core features to propose (must-have vs. nice-to-have)

## Must-have (MVP)

1. **NL Intent & Entity Parser** — extract intent (investigate/report), entities (user, IP, hostname, event types like `failed login`, `MFA`, `malware`), time ranges ("yesterday", "last week"), filters ("VPN", "source IP 10.x.x.x").
2. **Schema-Aware Query Generator** — maps parsed entities to the SIEM’s index fields and generates optimized Elasticsearch DSL or KQL (depends on target). Must fetch data-view / index mapping to be accurate. ([Elastic][1])
3. **Context Manager (Multi-turn)** — maintains dialogue state, remembers last query results, supports follow-ups (filter, refine, drill-down).
4. **Query Validator & Safety Layer** — dry-run / explain-plan + cost estimate; reject or rewrite very costly aggregations; enforce query timeouts. (See Query profiling & tuning guidance.) ([Elastic][2])
5. **SIEM Connector** — authenticated calls to Elastic/Kibana or Wazuh APIs to execute queries and fetch results. Use Wazuh REST API / Kibana APIs for integration. ([documentation.wazuh.com][3])
6. **Response Formatter** — table / narrative / charts (bar/time-series) and JSON raw hit drilldowns.
7. **Automated Report Builder** — natural-language summaries, charts, and downloadable PDF/ZIP forensic bundle on request.
8. **Clarification & Ambiguity Resolver** — proactive clarifying question when NL is ambiguous (e.g., “By ‘last week’ do you mean ISO week or last 7 days?”).
9. **Audit & Access Controls** — RBAC, logging of assistant actions, redact PII when needed.

## Nice-to-have (stretch)

* Natural language summarization of alerts (one-liner & one-paragraph).
* Search templates & macro caching for common forensic queries.
* Analyst feedback loop (mark TP/FP) to fine-tune mapping & prompt templates.
* Conversational history export & integration with ticketing (Jira/Trello).
* Voice interface (future).

# 3) Deep research & mapping strategies (NL → KQL/DSL)

### Key problems to solve

* **Schema mismatch:** users will say “failed logins” but index may use `event.action: "login_failed"` or `winlog.event_id:4625`. You must map user terms to actual field values.
* **Ambiguity:** temporal phrases, vague terms ("unusual activity"), and scope ("which hosts? all accounts?").
* **Efficiency & safety:** avoid queries that cause heavy aggregations on huge indices (timebox and sample).

### Recommended multi-layer strategy (practical + reliable)

1. **Schema Discovery (critical first step)**

   * At session start, fetch index mappings / data view from Kibana or index metadata from Elasticsearch / Wazuh indexer and build a `term → field` dictionary. This eliminates hallucinations mapping NL to non-existent fields. ([Elastic][4])

2. **Hybrid Query Generation (LLM + Rule/Template fallback)**

   * **Primary:** Use an LLM (or in-house seq2seq model) *prompted with the index mapping* and examples to generate DSL/KQL. Use RAG-like technique: include schema snippets + sample documents in prompt context to keep outputs schema-aware. Recent Elastic/AWS patterns recommend LLMs for NL→DSL with schema awareness and validation. ([Elastic][5])
   * **Fallback:** For critical queries (e.g., contain `bulk_aggregation`), use deterministic grammar/template generator (templates + slot-filling) to ensure safety and predictability.

3. **Validation / Execute-Safe Cycle (must implement)**

   * **Static validation:** check generated DSL for allowed field names, banned constructs (e.g., wildcard `*` scans on all indices), and an estimated cost (approx via `track_total_hits=false`, `terminate_after`, or `search_profile`).
   * **Dry-run & Explain:** run with small `size` and time-limited aggregations to ensure syntax & low cost. If validation fails, ask for clarification or rewrite using a safe template. AWS/Elastic best practices emphasize balancing accuracy, latency, and cost for NL->query systems. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][6])

4. **Ranking & Sampling for Chart/Report Requests**

   * For “summary with charts,” generate aggregations (date_histogram, terms). For large windows, use approximate aggregations or pre-aggregated indices (rollups) to maintain performance.

5. **Ambiguity Resolution & Dialogic Behavior**

   * If entity mapping confidence < threshold (e.g., LLM low-prob), prompt clarifying questions automatically (e.g., “Do you mean `winlog.event_id:4625` failed logins or authentication failures across Linux systems?”).

6. **Explainability for Analysts**

   * For each NL → DSL mapping, return the generated DSL plus a brief explanation of which NL tokens mapped to which fields (transparency improves trust).

**References**: Elastic’s blog experimented with ChatGPT→DSL and AWS has a prescriptive pattern for LLM → OpenSearch/Elasticsearch DSL — these support schema-aware LLM approaches and safety/validation recommendations. ([Elastic][5])

---

# 4) Models, libraries & tools (practical choices)

### NLP & LLM

* **Small/medium LLMs for edge or fine-tuning** (if offline): use a lightweight LLM that you can host or a hosted LLM for prototype (OpenAI/others). Use prompt-engineering + schema injection.
* **Fine-tune or few-shot** for NL→DSL patterns (collect 200–500 NL→DSL pairs to fine-tune or use few-shot examples). Research shows fine-tuning + self-checking improves accuracy on NL→SQL/DSL tasks. ([arXiv][7])

### Parser & entity extraction

* **spaCy / HuggingFace transformers** for NER (custom entities like `event_type`, `siem_field`)
* **Duckling / dateparser** for parsing date/time ranges (handle "last week", "yesterday", time zones)

### Validation & correction

* Use a *query-execution feedback* loop like SQLens (idea: detect semantic errors by running parts of the query or using execution hints). SQLens-style error detection/correction improves reliability for NL→SQL and applies here. ([arXiv][8])

### SIEM side

* **Kibana REST APIs / Elasticsearch APIs** — execute DSL, fetch index mappings, use Kibana saved objects. ([Elastic][4])
* **Wazuh API / Indexer API** — use Wazuh REST endpoints to run searches / queries programmatically. ([documentation.wazuh.com][3])

### Visualization & report generation

* **Plotly / Chart.js** for charts, **WeasyPrint / Puppeteer** to render PDFs for reports.

### Dev / infra

* **Backend:** FastAPI / Flask (Python) or Node Fastify.
* **Cache:** Redis (store recently used schema maps, query templates).
* **Auth:** OAuth2 / API keys integrated with existing SIEM auth or reverse-proxy.
* **Containerization:** Docker for demo.

---

# 5) Security, correctness & performance safeguards

1. **Schema check** before execution → prevents field-hallucination. (Pull index mapping at session start.) ([elasticsearch-dsl.readthedocs.io][9])
2. **Query timeouts / size limits / `terminate_after`** → avoid cluster impact. Use `track_total_hits=false` for heavy searches. ([Elastic][2])
3. **Least-privilege connector account** → SIEM connector must have only read/search capabilities (not management).
4. **Logging & Audit** → log assistant’s NL, generated DSL, result sample (redact PII).
5. **Explainable translations** → show generated DSL to analyst and allow “run anyway” or “edit” before final execute.
6. **Cost estimation** → before running heavy aggregations, show approximate cardinality and estimated time/cost.

---

# 6) MVP architecture (compact diagram described in text)

1. **Frontend Chat UI** (React) — shows chat, DSL preview, charts, table, drilldown.
2. **NL Orchestrator** (FastAPI) — receives NL, calls Parser & Context Manager.
3. **Context Manager & Session Store** (Redis) — stores conversation state, last queries, pinned filters.
4. **Schema Service** — fetches index mapping/data view from Kibana/Elasticsearch or Wazuh indexer and caches it.
5. **Query Generator** (LLM + template engine) — given parsed intent + schema → propose DSL/KQL.
6. **Validator** — static checks + dry-run sample execution.
7. **SIEM Connector** — Execute safe queries against Elastic/Wazuh using their APIs; return results. ([documentation.wazuh.com][3])
8. **Formatter** — narrative builder (short summary), table builder, chart builder.
9. **Report Builder** — assembles charts + narrative → PDF.
10. **Admin UI** — configure synonyms, mapping rules, thresholds.

---

# 7) 36-hour MVP sprint (task breakdown)

**Scope for MVP:** integrate with a local Elastic or Wazuh dev instance (or use public Elastic sandbox), implement NL→DSL for basic investigative queries + context, produce simple reports.

**Day 0 — Prep**

* Spin up Elastic (single-node) + sample logs (filebeat/syslog) or Wazuh dev; collect index mappings.
* Create repo skeleton, roles.

**Day 1 (0–12h) — Core pipeline**

* Build chat UI + backend skeleton (FastAPI).
* Implement Schema Service (fetch & cache mappings).
* Implement basic NL parser (dateparser + regex + spaCy for entities).
* Implement a template-based generator for straightforward queries (slot-fill templates for common intents like "failed logins", "top IPs last 24h").

**Day 1 (12–24h) — LLM integration + validation**

* Add LLM-based query generator (few-shot prompts containing sample mapping).
* Implement Validator: check field existence, banned patterns, add `terminate_after`/`timeout`.
* Hook to Elastic/Wazuh dev API to execute small safe queries.

**Day 2 (24–36h) — Context + Reports + polish**

* Implement Context Manager for follow-ups (store last filters, allow “Filter only VPN attempts”).
* Build Response Formatter: table + simple time-series charts.
* Implement automated report: generate a 1-page summary + 1 chart.
* Demo testing and prepare scripts.

---

# 8) Demo scripts (what to show judges — short & sharp)

1. **Investigate suspicious logins (multi-turn)**

   * Q1: “What suspicious login attempts occurred yesterday?” → Assistant returns time-series + top failed accounts.
   * Q2: “Filter only VPN-related attempts” → Assistant re-runs using prior context and returns filtered results.
   * Show DSL preview and analyst accepts before run.

2. **Drilldown + clarify**

   * Q: “Show me details for user ‘raj’” → Assistant asks “Which `raj`? raj@corp or raj.local?” (ambiguity resolution).
   * Show raw hits for chosen entity.

3. **Automated report**

   * Q: “Generate a summary of malware detections in the past month with charts.” → Assistant creates short narrative + bar chart + downloadable PDF.

4. **Safety demo**

   * Show a dangerous NL: “Give me everything indexed” → Assistant refuses or rewrites with safe time-bounded query and explains why.

---

# 9) Evaluation metrics (what judges will ask/show)

* **Translation accuracy**: % of NL queries converted to valid, intended DSL (evaluate on a test set).
* **Execution correctness**: % of generated queries whose results match analyst expectation (use labeled test queries).
* **Latency**: avg time NL -> DSL -> validate -> result (target < 3s for simple queries).
* **Robustness**: % of ambiguous NL resolved with minimal analyst prompts.
* **UX score**: ease-of-use, time saved vs manual KQL creation (qualitative + simple timed test).
* **Safety:** % of queries blocked by Validator.

---

# 10) Datasets & testcases to prepare

* **Synthetic SIEM logs** covering: auth/logon events, VPN logs, file access, malware alerts. (You can generate via log generators or use public sample datasets.)
* **Wazuh/ECS-like sample indices** — emulate field names used in mappings.
* Create 50–100 NL → expected KQL/DSL pairs for training/few-shot prompts and evaluation (include multi-turn sequences).

---

# 11) Concrete engineering tips & gotchas

* **Always fetch schema first** — LLMs hallucinate field names. Schema guards fix >90% mapping errors. ([elasticsearch-dsl.readthedocs.io][9])
* **Use a two-stage generation**: 1) LLM proposes DSL; 2) deterministic sanitizer + validator rewrites if needed. This follows enterprise Text2SQL best practices. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][10])
* **Cache common templates & common queries** to avoid repeated heavy work.
* **Expose DSL preview and require analyst confirmation** for critical or costly queries. Judges love explainability and control.
* **Keep responses short and actionable** — “Here’s the result. Want to filter by source IP or host?” — makes conversation natural.

---

# 12) Suggested tech stack (MVP)

* Backend: **FastAPI (Python)**
* NL: **spaCy** for light NER, **dateparser/Duckling** for times, **LLM** for mapping (hosted or fine-tuned)
* Validation & DSL crafting: small Python modules using `elasticsearch-py` & `elasticsearch-dsl`. ([elasticsearch-dsl.readthedocs.io][9])
* SIEM connectivity: **Kibana/Elasticsearch REST APIs** and **Wazuh API**. ([documentation.wazuh.com][3])
* Frontend: React + chat UI, charts via Plotly.
* Storage: Redis (session), Postgres (audit logs).
* Containerize with Docker Compose.

---

# 13) Risks & mitigations

* **Hallucinated fields / wrong queries** — mitigate via schema fetch + deterministic validation + dry-run. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][10])
* **Cluster overload** — set limits, timeouts, `terminate_after`, and use rollups/aggregations for large windows. ([Elastic][2])
* **Security / Data privacy** — read-only connector accounts; redact PII in UI and reports; log who asked what.
* **LLM cost & latency** — use on-device lightweight models for simple templates and call larger LLMs only for complex mapping (cost/latency trade). AWS/Elastic guidance recommends balancing accuracy and latency. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][6])

# 14) Suggested proposal paragraph (copy-paste friendly)

> **Proposed Solution — Conversational SIEM Assistant**
> We propose a middleware conversational assistant that enables multi-turn investigations and automated reporting for Elastic/Wazuh SIEMs. The assistant is schema-aware (fetches index mappings), translates natural language to validated KQL/Elasticsearch DSL using a hybrid LLM + template approach, validates/sanitizes queries to ensure safe execution, preserves conversation context, and returns structured tables, charts, and downloadable reports. Integration uses Kibana/Wazuh APIs with read-only connectors; PII is redacted and costly queries are timeboxed. MVP demonstrates multi-turn investigations, DSL preview, and report generation on dev SIEM data.

---

# 15) Next moves.

A) **Feature-by-feature technical spec** (endpoints, JSON schemas for index mapping, exact NL→DSL example pairs).
B) **Repo scaffold**: `docker-compose.yml`, minimal FastAPI backend stub, a simple template-based NL→DSL generator, and a React chat UI skeleton (copy-paste runnable).
C) **36-hour Kanban** with hourly assignments per role + scripted demo lines and acceptance tests.

---

# Evaluator’s Verdict (mentor summary)

This PS is extremely judge-friendly: solve a real usability gap (KQL/DSL skill barrier) for Elastic/Wazuh and demonstrate clear impact (faster investigations, fewer manual query errors). **Judges will care most about** (1) accuracy of NL→DSL (schema-aware), (2) safety & performance controls, and (3) the multi-turn UX. Build a demo that **proves the pipeline** (NL → DSL preview → safe execute → formatted result + report). That will score high.

# 💡 Key Gaps / What You Can Do That They Don’t (Differentiation)

From the above, here are the frequent gaps — opportunities you can propose or build to make your solution stand out:

1. **Multi-turn conversation / context preservation**
   Most tools allow single NL → query or simple filters. Very few support follow-up queries that refine or build on previous queries (e.g., “Filter only VPN attempts”, “Then show me failures only by a certain user”).

2. **Schema-aware mapping + validation + ambiguity resolution**
   Ensuring the natural language maps accurately to the SIEM schema (fields, indices) and asking clarifying questions when ambiguous. Very important but not fully covered by existing ones.

3. **Automated Reporting with Narrative + Charts + Downloadable Output**
   Generating summaries (“monthly malware detections with charts”) in both narrative + visual form, plus perhaps exporting PDFs or reports.

4. **Preview / Validation of Generated DSL / KQL + safety limits**
   Preventing runaway queries, giving preview so analysts can see the generated query before executing, handling performance issues, etc.

5. **User feedback loop, continuous learning**
   Allowing users / analysts to mark if results matched expectations (true positive / false positive), which improves the mapping or prompt templates.

6. **Full UI / UX polished for investigations**
   Conversational UI, showing raw results + summary + visualizations, drill down, etc.

7. **Open / Customizable**
   Tools that allow integration with any SIEM, custom index mappings, custom logs, etc., not locked to a paid tier or Elastic Cloud.

# 💡 What This Means for Your Proposal / Project

You can position your solution as **filling the gaps** that existing tools either partially meet or do not meet at all. In your proposal / pitch, you can highlight:

* There are emerging solutions (EQuIP, Wazuh integrations, Elastic’s Search AI etc.) → proof of concept that the idea is feasible and valued.
* But none of them fully satisfy the entire PS: multi-turn conversation, schema-aware query mapping, automated narrative + charts + downloadable reports, feedback loop, ambiguity resolution, safe execution etc.

So your solution can emphasize those missing pieces as key differentiators.

# 🧭 What This Means for Your Solution & How to Leverage These

Based on the competitor analysis, here are key lessons and differentiation points you can use / emphasize in your proposal:

1. **Use Elastic’s AI Assistant as proof-of-concept**
   You can acknowledge that Elastic already offers an “AI Assistant” in its Security Stack. But point out your enhancements: multi-turn context, full query previews, validation/safety, narrative + report exporting, clarifications, etc.

2. **Leverage NL2KQL’s methodology**

   * Reuse the idea of **schema refinement** (only relevant fields), few-shot examples + prompt design.
   * Use query repair / refiner phases to improve correctness (syntax + semantics).
   * Possibly use their datasets for benchmarking your own query mapping.

3. **Combine with reporting strengths of Wazuh**
   For report generation parts, you can use Wazuh’s existing reporting plugin to generate visuals / downloadables. But build the narrative + natural-language front end + filtering/search via NL on top of that.

4. **Add missing pieces as your differentiators**
   Emphasize in your pitch these features that are seldom in existing solutions:

   * Clarifying ambiguous queries → ask follow-ups when NL input is vague.
   * Preview of generated queries / ability to modify before executing.
   * Performance/safety controls (timeouts, terminate_after, cost estimates).
   * Narrative summaries + charts + downloadable formatted reports.
   * Full conversational UX (filtering based on previous queries, follow up).
   * Feedback loop / analyst marking of results to improve mapping/prompt templates.

5. **Open/Customizable & Schema-aware**
   Make sure your design supports accessing the actual SIEM’s index schema; support custom indices; works with Elastic / Wazuh / possibly other SIEMs. That gives reuse / flexibility advantage.

6. **Data & evaluation**
   Use NL2KQL’s dataset or similar for test queries. Show metrics (accuracy, validation, error correction) by comparing to benchmark or converting known NL→Query pairs.

### 🧩 Evaluator’s Verdict (Mentor View)

> You’ve hit a *rare high-impact PS* that blends **cybersecurity, AI, and NLP** — three SIH-priority domains.
> The gap between academic demos (NL2KQL) and enterprise solutions (Elastic AI Assistant) leaves a **sweet spot** for innovation that is practical, open-source, and India-ready (especially for DRDO/ISRO use cases).
> Focus on delivering a **functional prototype** that can:
> 1️⃣ Parse a query,
> 2️⃣ Execute it,
> 3️⃣ Display tabular + visual results,
> 4️⃣ Continue conversation with context.

That alone can **win internal track selections** easily.
