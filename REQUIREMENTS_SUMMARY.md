# 📦 Requirements Files Summary

## 🎯 **SIMPLIFIED STRUCTURE - ONLY 4 FILES NOW!**

| File | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `requirements.txt` | **Main development** | Local development, full features |
| `backend/requirements.txt` | **Backend service only** | API service deployment |
| `requirements-prod.txt` | **Production optimized** | Production servers |
| `requirements-docker.txt` | **Container deployment** | Docker builds |

## 🚀 **Quick Commands**

```bash
# Development (most common)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Backend service only
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Production deployment
pip install -r requirements-prod.txt

# Docker container
pip install -r requirements-docker.txt
```

## ✅ **What Was Cleaned Up**

**REMOVED** these unnecessary files:
- ❌ `requirements-flexible.txt` (redundant)
- ❌ `requirements-stable.txt` (redundant)  
- ❌ `requirements-dev.txt` (merged into main)

**KEPT** only the essential ones:
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Clean, simple main requirements
- ✅ `backend/requirements.txt` - Backend service focused
- ✅ `requirements-prod.txt` - Production optimized
- ✅ `requirements-docker.txt` - Container deployment

## 🎯 **Recommendation**

**Use `requirements.txt` for 99% of your development work!**

It has everything you need:
- All ML/NLP packages
- Web frameworks (Streamlit, FastAPI)
- Development tools
- Clean and simple format

**Much better now - only 4 focused requirements files instead of 7!** 🎉
